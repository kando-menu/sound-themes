# Sound Themes for Kando

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/kando-menu/sound-themes)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/kando-menu/sound-themes)
[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1124300911574003732?logo=discord&label=Discord&color=%235865f2)](https://discord.gg/hZwbVSDkhy)

[Kando](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando) can use sound themes to make the menu even more fun to use.
This repository contains themes that you can use with Kando.
You can easily [create your own theme](https://kando.menu/create-sound-themes/)!
If you created something cool, feel free to share it with the community by opening a pull request.

To install a theme, simply download this repository and copy the directory of the theme you want to use into the `sound-themes` directory of your Kando installation.
Depending on your platform, the `sound-themes` directory is located at:

- <img height="14" width="26" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Windows_logo_-_2021_%28Black%29.svg" /> Windows: `%appdata%\kando\sound-themes\`
- <img height="14" width="26" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/apple" /> macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/kando/sound-themes/`
- <img height="14" width="26" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/linux/black" /> Linux: `~/.config/kando/sound-themes/`

For now, Kando does not have an option in the settings to change the sound theme.
To use the theme, you have to set it in the `config.json` file.
Where this is located, you can learn [here](https://kando.menu/config-files/)!

> [!TIP]
> You can also join the [Kando Discord server](https://discord.gg/hZwbVSDkhy) to share your themes and get help with creating them!
